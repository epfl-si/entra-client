QUESTIONS TO SUPPORT
* Can we creat a template app from from an app? How?
* We don't have control over SP identifierID in SAML metadata file, how do we avoid "Values of identifierUris property must use a verified domain of the organization or its subdomain"
 in application configuration
* How can we make claims created by API manageable through portal (This configuration was overwritten by a claim mapping policy created via Graph/Powershell)
